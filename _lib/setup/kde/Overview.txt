NOTICE: Such generic suggested changes are of severely non-trivial health and mistake prevention benefit, *especially* for VR, VR overlay panel, PanelBoard, ~65inch triple monitor, triple projector, etc, users.

Dark mode in particular may prevent 'welders flash' eye surface irritation, severe Circadian Rhythm Disruption, etc. Visibility of seconds in clock is essential where unnoticed computer failure could cause user to crash a tool or vehicle. Expandable folders are essential to browse related documents or to develop software with the flexibility of desktop applications instead of an IDE. Significant workarounds (eg. of LibreOffice Icon near invisibility, VNC/RDP delays, etc) are specified.

One size fits all, mostly, defaults. Customization (eg. left-handedness, large font for developer prolonged text reading, etc) begins from this, NOT vice versa.
